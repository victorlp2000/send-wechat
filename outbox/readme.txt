Note:

  - To send image file to friend by WeChat, a folder with the same name as
    WeChat's friend name must be created in this outbox folder, then any file
    in the folder will be checked and send to the friend.

  - Any folder name starts with '~' will not be checked and is for testing

  - Any other file in outbox folder will also be ignored by WeChat, like this one.
